Analysis of Students Performance in Exams


The dataset is about the students' scores in math, reading, and writing exams, and some factors that may affect their performance, including students' gender, race, parental level of education, getting a standard or free/reduced lunch meal, and whether they completed the test preparation course or not.

Questions I intend to answer:
which subject did students perform best?
what are the major factors affecting students' testing scores based on the average total socre?
Is there any relationship between two factors affecting students' performance?
